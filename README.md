<samp>This is my first video game. I'm designing it in unity as a platformer.</samp>
<br> <br>
<samp>In this video game, you play as a character who represents a gear in a clock. 
One day, you start rusting due to the strong humidity in the clock, so you try to prevent rust while continuing to work.</samp>
<br> <br>
<samp>Code and art is completely made by me.</samp>
